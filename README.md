It seems to have this isssue: 
https://github.com/shekhargulati/cassandra-openshift-quickstart/issues/2

Usage is the same as described in *How To Configure and Run Cassandra on OpenShift* 
https://blog.openshift.com/cassandra-on-openshift/ the only difference is the command:

`git remote add upstream https://github.com/MassimoCappellano/cassandra-openshift-quickstart.git`

The OpenShift `diy` cartridge documentation can be found at:
